The Substack Importer allows you to import content from a Substack newsletter into your WordPress site.

== Description ==

The Substack Importer will import content from an export file downloaded from your Substack newsletter.

The following content will be imported:

 - Posts and images.
 - Podcasts.
 - Comments (only for publicly accessible posts).
 - Author information.

In the future, we plan to improve the importer by:

 - Mailing lists.
 - Enhancing the performance of processing export files with many posts and media.

To install the Substack Importer:

1. Upload the `substack-importer` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After about 30 seconds, the import stops and I am seeing a blank screen. What happened? =
When trying to import a large number of posts and images, timeouts can occur. To solve this, you can try to run the import
several times until all content has been imported.
